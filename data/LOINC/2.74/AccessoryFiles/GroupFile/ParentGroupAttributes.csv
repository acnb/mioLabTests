"LG100-4","Description","This parent group contains groups for terms in any of the following classes: CHEM, DRUG/TOX, CHAL, SERO, and ALLERGY. Each group contains terms with the same Component, Property, and Time aspect. The terms in a given group also have the same System, except when the System is in the intravascular or urine category, in which case terms that have any of the Systems in that category are rolled up. For example, a group for a given analyte in CSF only has terms with the System 'CSF', but a group for an analyte in an intravascular specimen contains terms with a variety of Systems, including 'Bld', 'Ser/Plas', 'BldV', etc. Some intravascular Systems are purposely excluded from this rollup, including cord blood ('BldCo') and dried blood spots (DBS)."
"LG103-8","Description","This parent group contains separate groups for individual viruses that are considered reportable by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A given group contains all of the terms that represent testing for a specific virus, regardless of the Method or type of result."

"LG27-5","Description","This parent group contains specific groups for each type of cell in a cell differential. Each individual group contains terms with the same cell type, Property (e.g., number concentration), Time aspect, and System, regardless of the Method. These groups mostly combine methodless terms with those that specify automated or manual counts."
"LG41751-5","Description","This parent group contains a single group of LOINC terms that represent concepts related to physical activity. These terms span a broad range of concepts, from quantitative exercise frequency and duration to activity preferences and physical activity protocols. This group relies on manual tagging of concepts related to exercise within the LOINC database, since there is no single unifying aspect for all of the LOINC terms contained in the group. Feedback about missing concepts or terms that should not be included is welcome."
"LG41762-2","Description","This parent group contains a single group for concepts related to Social determinants of health (SDOH). SDOH are defined as ""the structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age"" and are divided into several categories, including socioeconomic status, education, physical environment, employment, social support network, and access to health care. Examples of social conditions affecting health In the United States include the direct correlation between level of education and life expectancy and the inverse correlation between level of education and the likelihood of smoking. Attempts to improve the health of people in United States have historically focused primarily on the healthcare system itself, but studies have shown that  increasing access to quality healthcare does not translate into better health outcomes. To truly improve the health of all sectors of society a much broader approach must be developed that includes SDOH. [https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/beyond-health-care-the-role-of-social-determinants-in-promoting-health-and-health-equity/] Unlike most of the other LOINC Groups that are query-driven, this Group is defined manually since the LOINC terms related to SDOH do not have consistent attributes (e.g., Component or System) that can be queried. Feedback is welcome, as are new term requests to help fill in the LOINC content gaps for SDOH concepts."

"LG47-3","Description","This parent group contains individual groups for each vital sign, where each group contains terms that represent the more routine measurements for each vital sign.

All of the terms have a timing of point in time and do not include a challenge (e.g., standing or post bronchodilation) for that particular vital sign.  All of the vitals are defined as ""routine"" based on the following criteria: 1) all measurements are point in time (e.g., do not include min/max values for various time periods); 2) none of the terms include a challenge (e.g., standing or post bronchodilation); 3) blood pressure terms only include the ones where the System is 'Arterial system' or 'Brachial artery'; 4) respiratory rate terms only include those with a System of 'Respiratory system'; 5) temperature terms exclude those with a System of 'Finger', 'Toe' and 'Surface'; and 6) oxygen saturation terms only include those with a System that contains 'Bld*' and exclude Systems such as right and left atrium and ventricle and pulmonary artery."
