Parts with a Status of DEPRECATED may either be Parts that are: 1) not used for defining any published LOINC term or organizing part of the Component Hierarchy By System, and are not expected to be used in the future; or 2) those that are only used to define a deprecated LOINC term. Parts with a Status of INACTIVE are Parts that are no longer used, but that may be used again in the future.
