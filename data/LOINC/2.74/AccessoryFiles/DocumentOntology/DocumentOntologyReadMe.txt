Overview:
This file contains an export of the LOINC terms in the Document Ontology class (DOC.ONTOLOGY) and their values from each axis of the Document Ontology. The axis values are identified by LOINC Part Numbers and classified according their type (Setting, Type of Service, etc). Some LOINC terms contain combinations of Document Ontology values from within the same axis, and the PartSequenceOrder value indicates the proper order of each one within that axis. 

For more information on the LOINC Document Ontology, see the LOINC Users' Guide.

The Document Ontology file contains the following columns:
 - LoincNumber - the LOINC term identifier, which is a unique numeric identifier with a check digit
 - PartNumber - the LOINC Part Number, which is a unique identifier that starts with the prefix "LP"
 - PartTypeName - the type of Part. Examples: Document.TypeOfService, Document.Setting
 - PartSequenceOrder - indicates the proper order of Parts within the axis
 - PartName - the name of the Part. Examples: Note, Consultation, Physician

Sort order:
This file is sorted by LoincNumber followed by PartTypeName and then PartSequenceOrder. The PartTypeName is sorted in the following order: Document.Kind --> Document.TypeOfService --> Document.Setting --> Document.SubjectMatterDomain --> Document.Role.

Note:
This file does not contain any deprecated LOINC terms.
